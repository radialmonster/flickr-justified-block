### Flickr API Setup

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Flickr API key? =

A Flickr API key is only required if you want to use Flickr photo page URLs. The block works perfectly with direct image URLs without any API key. Get a free API key at [Flickr App Garden](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/) and add it via Settings ‚Üí Flickr Justified.

= What image formats are supported? =

The block supports JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, GIF, and SVG formats. For Flickr photos, it automatically fetches the best available quality.

= How do I change the number of columns? =

Use the "Columns" setting in the block sidebar. You can choose from 1-6 columns. The layout automatically becomes responsive on smaller screens.

= Can I mix Flickr URLs with direct image URLs? =

Yes! You can combine both Flickr photo page URLs and direct image URLs in the same gallery.

= How does caching work? =

Flickr API responses are cached for 1 week to improve performance and reduce API usage. The cache automatically refreshes when needed.

= What are random breakouts? =

Random breakouts allow galleries to be split into multiple sections with configurable probability. Enable this feature in the block settings to create more dynamic, varied gallery layouts.

Absolutely! The justified gallery layout automatically adjusts to 2 columns on tablets and 1 column on mobile devices for optimal viewing.
